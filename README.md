# Micron NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Challenge 2023
Our team placed within the Top 5 Finalists among hundreds of submissions.

## Background
From 5G smartphones to the AI-enabled cloud, memory fuels everything that computes and is essential to growing the data economy. To address 2030-era demand for memory, Micron plans to invest more than $150 billion globally in manufacturing and R&D over the next decade.

Micron Semiconductor, as one of major suppliers of DRAM and NAND memory chips, have invested heavily in expanding its own capacity through acquiring new plant. In 2022, Micron Semiconductor announced to invest up to $100 billion to build Mega-fab in Central New York, United States. On top of acquiring new plants, Micron Semiconductor have also expanded its existing plants, including a two-time expansion in Singapore in 2016 and 2019, and a recent announcement to expand in Boise, Idaho, to accelerate the production ramp of advanced memory technology. 
  
In this Business Analytics Case Competition, we will take a deeper dive into the location planning to strategically increase our production capabilities.
